## Description

Search platform for perfumes with 2 types of users, creating the favorite list for one and allowing the other to add/edit/delete.


<br>

## User Stories

- **404** - As a user I want to see a nice 404 page when I go to a page that doesnâ€™t exist so that I know it was my fault
- **500** - As a user I want to see a nice error page when the super team screws it up so that I know that is not my fault
- **homepage** - You'd be able to see a list of perfumes, but not search them or favourite. You'll be redirected to  log in and sign up on that page. 
- **sign up** - As a user I want to sign up on the web page as a regular user or as a store representative
- **login** - As a user I want to be able to log in on the web page so that I can get back to my account
- **logout** - As a user I want to be able to log out from the web page so that I can make sure no one will access my account
- **favorite list** - As a user I want to see the list of my favorite and delete them.
- **edit user** - As a user I want to be able to edit my profile.
- **edit pages** - As a store representative user I want to be able to edit the details of the perfumes and update avilability .
- **result** - As a user I want to see the list of perfumes filter by my preferences.
- **perfume listing** - As a user I want to see more details of the perfume, be able to call them and visit their website and save it as favorites.
